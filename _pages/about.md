I'm a software engineer and game developer with a deep passion for the technical side of crafting immersive game experiences. Leveraging my skills in gameplay programming, engine development, and rendering techniques, I bridge the gap between creative vision and playable reality. 

Fueled by a strong foundation in computer science and the arts, I'm constantly seeking opportunities to expand my technical knowledge and push the boundaries of what I am capable of.
