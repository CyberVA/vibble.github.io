# Welcome to my projects page!

*You might have noticed.... everything is **empty.*** Why is that?
Currently, I'm in the process of migrating all of my work to this new portfolio website. Part of that effort will include having these project pages where I can go a *little* more in-depth on what I worked on.

Doing this will take time, and I intend to treat it as both a showcase of my work and a way to revisit, explore, and explain my process for some of my older projects. 

For now, you can check out my projects on my [CV](https://vibbel.github.io/cv/#projects-1).

### Thanks for your patience!
